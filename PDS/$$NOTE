Here are two files from my site in TSO XMIT format:

    1)  XMITMAIL - a "lite, fast" version of XMITIP, written in
COBOL, callable from any HLL in batch or CICS.  Attachments
only supported if you format them yourself. (File 490)

    2)  INSTASM   -  library of macros useful for reentrant
assembler programming, including a reentrant date conversion
routine.                                    (File 491)

Much thanks to Lionel Dyck.  His version of XMITIP (the original,
written in REXX) is on File 312 of the CBT Tape.
