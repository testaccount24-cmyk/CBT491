Sam, here are up to date versions of the MVS freeware I have
written, for the CBT tape.  They are in zipped binary XMIT
format.  I am not sure if they are on the tape or the overflow
already - I have a feeling I sent versions a few years ago but I
can't find them - but if they are they won't be up to date.


LECH
A sample LE condition handler. Code two COPY statements in your
cobol mainline. Interrupts will be intercepted with a dump and a
message and your program will continue to run.

BATCHART.
Drive the GDDM-PGF CHART utility in batch using a SYSIN-type file
of commands. No terminal required.  Create gifs in batch.

INSTASM
A set of assembler macros useful for building re-entrant
assembler programs, date handling, parsing and stringing, and
some utilities.

XMITCICS / XMITMAIL
"lite" version of XMITIP, in Cobol, usable from CICS
