//***FILE 491 is from Andy Robertson and contains a "lite" version  *   FILE 491
//*           of XMITIP which is written in COBOL.  Lionel Dyck's   *   FILE 491
//*           "original" version of XMITIP is on File 314 of this   *   FILE 491
//*           tape.  Lionel's (File 314) version is written in      *   FILE 491
//*           REXX.  These programs allow the sending of email      *   FILE 491
//*           messages from your MVS machine if you have an SMTP    *   FILE 491

//*           This file has been modified to include Andy's         *   FILE 491

//*        The GDFs can be displayed on a 3720-type terminal,       *   FILE 491
//*        printed on an AFP printer, plotted, or saved as          *   FILE 491

//*        To generate the BATCHART installation pds, just run the  *   FILE 491
//*        job $PDSLOAD.  This will generate the other pds'es also. *   FILE 491
